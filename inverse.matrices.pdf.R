# The Inverse of a Matrix (pdf)
# The inverse of a square n × n matrix A, is another n × n matrix denoted by A−1 such that
# AA^−1= A^−1A= I
# where I is the n × n identit y matrix. 
# That is, multiplying a matrix by its inverse produces an identit y matrix. 
# Not all square matrices have an inverse matrix. 
# If the determinant of the matrix is zero, then it will not have an inverse, 
# and the matrix is said to be singular. 
# Only non-singular matrices have inverses.



# Given any non-singular matrix A, its inverse can be found from the formula
# A^−1 = adj A/|A|
# where adj A is the adjoint matrix and |A| is the determinan t of A. 
# The procedure for finding the adjoint matrix is given below.
